## About Me

I am a highly motivated IT professional with expertise in data science, machine learning operations (MLOps), and IT infrastructure management. Currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at Malmö University, I bring a solid foundation in statistics, programming, and machine learning algorithms, coupled with practical experience in server management, data pipelines, and automation scripting.

My technical skills span across operating systems, virtualization tools, and networking security protocols, with a hands-on understanding of Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure. My professional experience includes roles in IT support and engineering, where I have optimized workflows, automated tasks, and maintained complex systems.

Passionate about solving challenging problems, I thrive in collaborative environments and continuously seek to learn and adapt to emerging technologies. Fluent in English, Swedish, Pashto, Farsi, and Dari, I am well-equipped to work in diverse, multicultural teams.
