## About Me

I am a dedicated and detail-oriented individual currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at Malmö
University. With a strong academic foundation in programming, operating systems, and network administration, I
have developed practical skills that align with the demands of modern IT environments.
My hands-on experience with Linux and Windows servers, virtualization tools such as Docker and Hyper-V, and
network security protocols has prepared me to manage and optimize complex systems effectively. During my role as
an IT Support Intern, I honed my ability to troubleshoot, provide technical guidance, and create clear documentation
to support users and team members alike.
What drives me is the challenge of creating reliable, secure, and efficient IT infrastructures. My scripting abilities
with Bash and PowerShell allow me to automate repetitive tasks, improving productivity and system reliability.
Fluent in English and Swedish, I thrive in diverse, collaborative environments where communication and teamwork
are essential.
I am passionate about continuously learning and adapting to new technologies, ensuring that I stay ahead in this
fast-evolving field. My commitment to problem-solving and delivering impactful solutions makes me an asset to any
organization.
